# CSE341 Class Project: Building an API with JavaScript and MongoDB

## Overview
This project is part of the CSE341 (Backend Development) course, which focuses on building RESTful APIs using JavaScript and MongoDB. The project demonstrates how to design, implement, and deploy a fully functional API that can handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows clients to interact with a database by sending HTTP requests to perform operations on resources such as users, products, or any other entities.

### Features:
- **RESTful API Endpoints:** Create, read, update, and delete resources using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Store and retrieve data from a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling for invalid requests and server errors.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure valid data using libraries like Joi or built-in validation with Mongoose.
- **Security:** Basic authentication and input sanitization.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (Node.js):** Server-side programming language.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing the application data.
- **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
- **Postman/Insomnia:** For testing the API.
- **Git:** Version control system.

## Installation
